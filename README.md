# GenAI_AWS_Bedrock_Projects
## Project 1: Text-to-Image Generation using AWS Lambda and Stable Diffusion
### Description
Developed an end-to-end solution for generating images from textual descriptions using a generative AI model (Stable Diffusion). The project integrates AWS Lambda for serverless execution, AWS Bedrock for model invocation, and Amazon S3 for storing the generated images.

### Key Responsibilities
Generative AI Implementation: Utilized the Stable Diffusion model to generate high-quality images based on text prompts.
Cloud Integration: Implemented the solution using AWS Lambda for scalable and cost-effective execution. Integrated AWS Bedrock to invoke the AI model and used Amazon S3 to store the generated images.
Data Processing: Processed input text and managed the AI model's payloads and responses efficiently.
Error Handling and Optimization: Ensured robust error handling and optimized the process for performance and reliability.

### Technologies Used
* Python
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Bedrock
* Amazon S3
* Stable Diffusion
* JSON
* Base64

### Outcome
Successfully deployed a scalable and efficient solution for generating images from text, reducing manual design time and providing high-quality outputs for various applications.


## Project 2: Automated Code Generation using Generative AI
### Description
Developed an automated code generation tool that creates code snippets based on user-provided instructions and programming language specifications. The solution leverages AWS Lambda for execution, AWS Bedrock for model invocation, and Amazon S3 for storing the generated code.

### Key Responsibilities
Generative AI for Code: Used Anthropic Claude-v2 model to generate programming code from natural language descriptions.
End-to-End Solution: Designed and implemented the entire pipeline from user input processing to code generation and storage.
Cloud Services Integration: Deployed the solution using AWS Lambda for serverless execution and Amazon S3 for persistent storage of generated code.
Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to ensure reliable operation and high availability.

### Technologies Used
* Python
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Bedrock
