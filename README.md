# GenAI_AWS_Bedrock_Projects
## Project 1: Text-to-Image Generation using AWS Lambda and Stable Diffusion
### Description
Developed an end-to-end solution for generating images from textual descriptions using a generative AI model (Stable Diffusion). The project integrates AWS Lambda for serverless execution, AWS Bedrock for model invocation, and Amazon S3 for storing the generated images.

### Key Responsibilities
Generative AI Implementation: Utilized the Stable Diffusion model to generate high-quality images based on text prompts.
Cloud Integration: Implemented the solution using AWS Lambda for scalable and cost-effective execution. Integrated AWS Bedrock to invoke the AI model and used Amazon S3 to store the generated images.
Data Processing: Processed input text and managed the AI model's payloads and responses efficiently.
Error Handling and Optimization: Ensured robust error handling and optimized the process for performance and reliability.
